# A modern tech team working on public sector problems

We are motivated by problems that have strong impact on the public. We listen to issues on the ground and take them back to experiment and develop technology for the public good. Our role is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Singapore Government by being a space where we can experiment with new tech practices, including new technologies, management techniques, corporate systems, and even cultural norms. Our end goal is that through our work, Singapore becomes a model of how governments can use technology to improve the public good.
